## Advanced Filtering Features

### 1. Content Filtering
- **Date Range**: `date_from` and `date_to` parameters
- **Category**: Filter by category ID
- **Tags**: Filter by tag ID

- **Type and Category**: Filter by organization type and category
- **User Relationships**: Filter by user memberships

## Search Capabilities

### 1. Full-text Search
- Search across title, content, slug fields
- Case-insensitive search
- Partial matching support

### 2. Advanced Search
- Multiple field search
- Combined with filtering
- Pagination-aware results

## Custom Actions Implemented

- `publish/` - Publish content
- `unpublish/` - Unpublish content
- `comments/` - Get related comments

### 2. Organization Actions
- `verify/` - Verify organization
- `offices/` - Get organization offices
- `members/` - Get organization members

- `update_profile/` - Update user profile

### 4. Membership Actions
- `approve/` - Approve membership
- `reject/` - Reject membership
- `my_memberships/` - Get user's memberships

## Integration Tests

Comprehensive test suite implemented covering:
- CRUD operations for all endpoints
- Permission testing
- Filtering and search functionality
- Custom actions
- Error handling
- Authentication flows

## API Response Format

All endpoints follow consistent response format:
- Paginated responses for list endpoints
- Consistent error handling
- Proper HTTP status codes
- JSON responses with appropriate serialization

## Security Features

1. **Role-based Access Control**: Different permission levels for different user types
2. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation using Django REST Framework serializers
3. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with proper token handling
4. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of admin operations and system activities
5. **Status Filtering**: Content visibility based on user permissions

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Optimization**: Use of `select_related` and `prefetch_related` for efficient queries
2. **Pagination**: Implemented pagination for large datasets
3. **Caching**: Ready for caching implementation
4. **Query Optimization**: Efficient filtering and search queries

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **4.1**: Admin interface for content management - Comprehensive admin endpoints with full CRUD operations
✅ **4.2**: Content management with proper permissions - Role-based access control implemented
✅ **4.3**: Activity monitoring - Activity log endpoints for admin monitoring
✅ **5.1**: API compatibility - RESTful API design with consistent response format
