# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the systematic resolution of 76+ TypeScript compilation errors and bugs across both admin-frontend and wellknown-frontend applications. The primary issues are JSX syntax errors in test files, unterminated string literals, and malformed React component syntax that prevent successful TypeScript compilation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript compilation errors to be resolved, so that the codebase can be built and deployed successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npx tsc --noEmit` in admin-frontend THEN the system SHALL return zero TypeScript errors
2. WHEN running `npx tsc --noEmit` in wellknown-frontend THEN the system SHALL return zero TypeScript errors
3. WHEN building both frontend applications THEN the system SHALL complete builds without compilation failures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test files to have correct JSX syntax, so that tests can run properly and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining test files THEN all JSX components SHALL have properly closed tags
2. WHEN examining QueryClientProvider usage THEN all JSX syntax SHALL be correctly formatted
3. WHEN running test suites THEN all test files SHALL parse without syntax errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all string literals to be properly terminated, so that the code is syntactically valid.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining TypeScript files THEN all string literals SHALL be properly closed with matching quotes
2. WHEN examining test descriptions THEN all string literals SHALL be complete and valid
3. WHEN parsing files THEN no unterminated string literal errors SHALL occur

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code formatting across both frontend applications, so that the codebase maintains quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining similar files across admin-frontend and wellknown-frontend THEN they SHALL follow consistent patterns
2. WHEN fixing syntax errors THEN the fixes SHALL maintain existing code style and functionality
3. WHEN completing fixes THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact
