# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the systematic resolution of 142 additional TypeScript compilation errors in admin-frontend that were discovered after fixing the initial JSX syntax errors. These errors prevent the application from compiling properly and include missing imports, type mismatches, and missing dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all missing import/export errors to be resolved, so that modules can be properly imported and used throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing `apiClient` from services THEN the system SHALL provide the correct export
2. WHEN importing `toast` from hooks THEN the system SHALL provide the correct export
3. WHEN importing `useAuth` from hooks THEN the system SHALL provide the correct export
4. WHEN importing `searchService` from API services THEN the system SHALL provide the correct export

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all missing dependencies to be installed or properly configured, so that external libraries can be used without compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Material-UI components THEN the system SHALL have proper type declarations
2. WHEN using date-fns utilities THEN the system SHALL have proper type declarations  
3. WHEN using vitest in tests THEN the system SHALL have proper type declarations
4. WHEN building the application THEN all external dependencies SHALL be resolved

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all type interface mismatches to be resolved, so that TypeScript can properly validate the code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using SearchContext THEN all properties SHALL match the defined interface
2. WHEN using API client methods THEN all parameters SHALL match expected types
3. WHEN using Table components THEN column definitions SHALL match expected interfaces
4. WHEN accessing object properties THEN all properties SHALL exist on the defined types

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all implicit 'any' type errors to be resolved, so that the code maintains proper type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining event handlers THEN all parameters SHALL have explicit types
2. WHEN using array methods THEN all callback parameters SHALL have explicit types
3. WHEN accessing form elements THEN all properties SHALL have proper type annotations
4. WHEN the TypeScript compiler runs THEN no implicit 'any' errors SHALL occur
