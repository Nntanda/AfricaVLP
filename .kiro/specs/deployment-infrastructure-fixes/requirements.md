# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project focuses on resolving critical deployment and infrastructure issues that are preventing the AU-VLP (African Union Youth Leadership Program) system from running properly in the Docker environment. The system consists of multiple services including Django backends, React frontends, MySQL database, Redis, Celery workers, and Nginx, but several services are failing to start due to configuration and build issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Docker containers to start successfully, so that I can have a fully functional development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running docker-compose up THEN all services SHALL start without errors
2. WHEN containers are running THEN they SHALL maintain stable status without frequent restarts
3. WHEN checking container logs THEN there SHALL be no critical errors preventing service startup
4. WHEN services depend on each other THEN they SHALL start in the correct order and establish connections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the React frontend applications to build successfully, so that I can access the user interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the admin-frontend THEN the TypeScript compilation SHALL complete without errors
2. WHEN building the wellknown-frontend THEN the Vite build process SHALL complete successfully
3. WHEN frontend containers start THEN they SHALL serve the applications on their designated ports
4. WHEN accessing the frontends THEN they SHALL load without JavaScript errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Django backends to start properly, so that I can access the API endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin-backend starts THEN it SHALL successfully connect to the MySQL database
2. WHEN the wellknown-backend starts THEN it SHALL import all Django models without errors
3. WHEN Django migrations run THEN they SHALL complete successfully with the existing database
4. WHEN accessing API endpoints THEN they SHALL respond with proper HTTP status codes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper database connectivity, so that the applications can read and write data correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Django connects to MySQL THEN it SHALL use the existing database schema without conflicts
2. WHEN database migrations are applied THEN they SHALL not interfere with existing data
3. WHEN applications query the database THEN they SHALL receive expected results
4. WHEN database transactions occur THEN they SHALL maintain data integrity

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all supporting services to function correctly, so that the complete system operates as intended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redis starts THEN it SHALL be accessible by Django and Celery services
2. WHEN Celery workers start THEN they SHALL connect to Redis and process tasks
3. WHEN Nginx starts THEN it SHALL properly proxy requests to backend services
4. WHEN all services are running THEN they SHALL communicate with each other successfully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error messages and logs, so that I can quickly identify and resolve any remaining issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services fail to start THEN they SHALL provide clear error messages in logs
2. WHEN configuration issues occur THEN they SHALL be clearly documented in container output
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN log levels SHALL provide sufficient detail
4. WHEN services recover from errors THEN they SHALL log successful recovery actions
