# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves rebuilding the existing CakePHP-based admin and well-known applications using modern technologies while preserving the existing MySQL database structure. The admin side will be rebuilt as a Django REST API backend with a React frontend for the administrative interface. The well-known side (client-facing application for volunteers and organizations) will be rebuilt as a React frontend application with Django replacing the CakePHP backend. The system appears to be related to the African Union Youth Leadership Program (AU-VLP) based on the database content, handling blog posts, admin management, activity logs, and various program-related data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate from CakePHP to Django for the backend API, so that I can leverage Django's robust admin interface, ORM capabilities, and modern Python ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Django backend is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide REST API endpoints equivalent to the existing CakePHP functionality
2. WHEN database models are created THEN Django SHALL use the existing MySQL database schema without requiring data migration
3. WHEN the Django admin interface is configured THEN it SHALL provide comprehensive management capabilities for all data models
4. WHEN authentication is implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing admin user accounts and password hashes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an end user, I want both the admin and well-known applications rebuilt with React frontends, so that I can experience a modern, responsive, and interactive user interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the React frontends are implemented THEN they SHALL consume the Django REST API endpoints
2. WHEN users interact with the applications THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
3. WHEN content is displayed THEN the system SHALL support multilingual content (based on existing translation features)
4. WHEN users navigate the applications THEN the system SHALL provide smooth single-page application experiences

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to preserve the existing MySQL database structure, so that no data is lost during the migration and existing integrations continue to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Django models are created THEN they SHALL map exactly to existing database tables and columns
2. WHEN the applications run THEN they SHALL use the existing database without requiring schema changes
3. WHEN data is accessed THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing relationships between tables
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing data SHALL remain intact and accessible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to manage blog posts, admin users, and activity logs through the new system, so that I can continue administrative tasks without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the admin interface THEN the system SHALL allow me to create, read, update, and delete blog posts
2. WHEN managing users THEN the system SHALL allow me to handle admin accounts with different roles (super_admin, admin)
3. WHEN reviewing system activity THEN the system SHALL allow me to view and filter activity logs
4. WHEN working with content THEN the system SHALL allow me to manage multilingual content and translations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new system to maintain API compatibility, so that any existing integrations or third-party services continue to function.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN they SHALL provide the same data structure as the original system
2. WHEN external services make requests THEN they SHALL receive responses in expected formats
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the API SHALL support the same authentication mechanisms
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully with appropriate HTTP status codes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper deployment and configuration management, so that the new system can be deployed and maintained efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL include proper environment configuration management
2. WHEN running in production THEN it SHALL include appropriate security measures and HTTPS support
3. WHEN monitoring is needed THEN it SHALL provide logging and error tracking capabilities
4. WHEN scaling is required THEN the architecture SHALL support horizontal scaling of both frontend and backend components

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an organization representative, I want to access and manage my organization's profile and resources through the well-known application, so that I can effectively participate in the AU-VLP program.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the well-known application THEN I SHALL be able to view and update my organization's profile
2. WHEN managing resources THEN I SHALL be able to upload, categorize, and share relevant documents
3. WHEN participating in events THEN I SHALL be able to register and track participation
4. WHEN communicating with program administrators THEN I SHALL have access to appropriate communication channels
